    synopsis: "Where games meet drugs",
    description: "LSD Jam is a game jam I participated in during April 2024 together with Cyril Ojoga. The theme was LSD, and the goal was to create a game that makes the player question which of the realities they experience is their actual life. The game takes the player through a series of realities, dying and waking up after a short series of events in each one. I created the 3D art, Textures, level layouts and lighting setups for the jam, as well as the promotional material. The game was made in Unity, and the 3D art was created in Blender.",
